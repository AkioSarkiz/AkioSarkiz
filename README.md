👋 Hi, I’m @AkioSarkiz (Dmyto Laptiev)

👀 I’m passionate about exploring the vast realms of technology and bringing innovative solutions to life. My focus is on creating seamless user experiences through web development and mastering the art of Full Stack Development.

🌱 I’m currently enhancing my skills in various technologies, including front-end frameworks like React.js and Next.js, as well as back-end technologies such as Node.js and Hono.js. I maintain the [manga-collector package](https://github.com/AkioSarkiz/manga-collector).

💞️ I’m eager to collaborate on exciting projects that challenge the status quo and push the boundaries of what’s possible in the digital landscape. Whether it’s building robust web applications, optimizing database performance, or implementing cutting-edge features, I’m ready to contribute my skills to innovative and forward-thinking teams.

📫 How to reach me: Feel free to drop me an email at akiosarkiz@gmail.com. I’m always open to networking and discussing potential collaborations or opportunities.

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: When not immersed in coding, you can find me working out, reading novels, or watching anime. I believe that a well-balanced life outside of coding enhances creativity and brings a unique perspective to problem-solving.
